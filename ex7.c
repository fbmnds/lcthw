       - ex7.c:1-4 The usual start of a C program.
       - ex7.c:5-6 Declare an int and double for some fake bug data.
       - ex7.c:8-9 Print out those two, so nothing new here.
       - ex7.c:11 Declare a huge number using a new type long for storing big numbers.
       - ex7.c:12-13 Print out that number using %ld which adds a modifier to the usual %d. Adding ’l’ (the letter ell) means "print this as a long decimal".
       - ex7.c:15-17 Just more math and printing.
       - ex7.c:19-21 Craft up a depiction of your bug rate compared to the bugs in the universe, which is a completely inaccurate calculation. It’s so small though that we have to use %e to print it in scientific notation.
       - ex7.c:24 Make a character, with a special syntax '\0' which creates a ’nul byte’ character. This is effectively
      the number 0.
       - ex7.c:25 Multiply bugs by this character, which produces 0 for how much you should care. This demonstrates an ugly hack you find sometimes.
       - ex7.c:26-27 Print that out, and notice I’ve got a %% (two percent chars) so I can print a ’%’ (percent) character.
       - ex7.c:28-30 The end of the main function.
