That’s similar to char *, which is a   "pointer to char", and a string is an array of chars. Seeing the similarity yet?  Create a pointer that points at names. A char * is already a "pointer to char",   so that’s just a string. You however need 2 levels, since names is 2-dimensional,  that means you need char ** for a "pointer to (a pointer to char)" type.

Why does that work?    The increment part of the for-loop then increments both cur_name and cur_age     so that they point at the next element of the name and age arrays.    The pointers cur_name and cur_age are now pointing at one element of the arrays     they work on, and we can print them out using just *cur_name and *cur_age, which    means "the value of wherever cur_name is pointing".  */  printf("loop 3:\n");  for (iptr = ages, cptr = names; iptr - ages < count_ages; iptr++, cptr++)    printf("%s is %d years old.\n", *cptr, *iptr);  return 0;}
